                <p>Air cargo carriers are pushing customers to use electronic air waybills, which experts say are key to improving processes, increasing shipment visibility and eliminating errors.</p>
                <p>Earlier this year, for instance, IAG Cargo implemented a charging fee for using paper AWBs as the company strives to digitize its operations and procedures.</p>
                <p>The eAWB has been available for more than 10 years. But the air cargo industry at large has lagged in shipping document digitization, Chief Transformation Officer David Rose told Supply Chain Dive.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Air cargo has historically relied heavily on paper processes for the contract of carriage between freight forwarders and airlines, and our customers &hellip; are likely accustomed to it,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
                <p>The carrier hopes to achieve full eAWB adoption from its customers by the end of the year. Fewer than half of IAG Cargo&rsquo;s customers currently use the digital option.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We want to change that,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>

                <p>Volatile demand trends over the past few years have made forecasting ocean shipping cargo volumes more difficult, according to the head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is no longer any seasonality or predictability to the cargo peaks and valleys that our industry had become accustomed to,&rdquo; port director Beth Rooney said in a State of the Port briefing on Jan. 25. &nbsp;Cargo volumes, which soared at many ports over the past few years, are now being met with softening demand. The trend comes as retailers pull back orders to clear inventories and the warehouse market shows signs of cooling due to demand slowdown.</p>

                <p>Capturing the full environmental, social, and financial benefits of corporate sustainability requires a focus well beyond the four walls of your facilities.</p>
                <p>Why? Because manufacturers and supply chain leaders rely on hundreds or thousands of suppliers for:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Components and materials</li>
                <li>Product packaging</li>
                <li>Maintenance, repair and operations inventory</li>
                <li>Technology solutions</li>
                <li>Transportation and logistics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, it takes only a single supplier&rsquo;s environmental failure to tarnish your brand. Just as important, suppliers with a focus on sustainability can make themselves more competitive &mdash; and improve your bottom line, too.</p>
                <p>In fact, a recent CDP study found that 95 percent of organizations report that suppliers demonstrating environmental leadership in sustainable practices are more competitive; only 5 percent say these suppliers are more costly. In addition, 65 percent of CDP members &mdash; with a combined procurement spend of $3.6 trillion and more than 7,000 suppliers &mdash; report using environmental metrics in their supplier relationship management processes, with another 30 percent planning to do so within two years.</p>

                <p>Victoria&rsquo;s Secret has been moving shipments away from air in favor of ocean transport as freight rates stabilize, Chief Finance and Administrative Officer Tim Johnson said on a Dec. 1 earnings call.</p>
                <p>The retailer expects the modal shift to help abate burgeoning costs. The company had seen supply chain costs rise by roughly $300 million last holiday season due in part to a reliance on air freight. Now, the company expects closer to $100 million in incremental supply chain costs from fall 2022 to spring 2023.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;As we move into 2022 and [the] supply chain started to get incrementally better from a flow perspective, it gave us the confidence that we could start taking merchandise off of airplanes and start putting it on boats,&rdquo; Johnson told analysts.</p>

                <h4>Dive Insight:</h4>
                <p>During Q3 last year, Victoria&rsquo;s Secret was nearly entirely dependent on transporting merchandise via airfreight, especially during the holiday season. At the time, the company had ordered 200 million units of stock for the fall season, 45% of which were delayed between 2 to 9 weeks, CEO Martin Waters told investors during a Q3 2021 earnings call.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In some cases, we won&rsquo;t get the merchandise at all. So, all of our plans are being reworked, [and] 90% of our merchandise will come in by air,&rdquo; Waters said during the call. &ldquo;In addition to that we have 100 vessels at anchor right now that are not coming to shore.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>At the time, rising ocean and air rates as well as higher raw materials prices led the retailer to forecast higher supply chain YoY expenses, the CFO shared.</p>
                <p>Since then, ocean and air rates have normalized compared to last year&rsquo;s high cost environment. Transpacific spot rates in November were down 32% YoY for air cargo, and 79% YoY for ocean shipments, according to Xeneta&rsquo;s Clive Data Services.</p>
                <p>Now, Victoria&rsquo;s Secret joins the list of retailers optimistic about margins as freight costs continue to soften going into 2023. Gap also saw improved margins in Q3 as air freight rates normalized YoY spending levels.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;When we think about the margin &hellip; we do expect to have some tailwind as we go into spring season, particularly around freight rates and freight opportunity year over year,&rdquo; Johnson told analysts.<br><br>Click on the link to read the full article:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.supplychaindive.com/news/victorias-secret-modal-shifts-drive-freight-savings-q3/638261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.supplychaindive.com/news/victorias-secret-modal-shifts-drive-freight-savings-q3/638261/</a></p>

                <p>A boost in international flights to keep up with summer travel demand helped August air cargo capacity grow 7% YoY, according to Clive. Now, global capacity is just 9% away from recovering to 2019 levels.</p>
                <p>At the same time, airlines are facing a tepid cargo demand environment compared to 2021. Inflationary pressures, elevated inventory levels in the U.S., the war in Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdowns in China presenting ongoing challenges for the market, according to Clive. Shippers are also being drawn away due to improving reliability in ocean shipping.</p>

                <p>By building out zero-emission maritime corridors, major trade partners can catalyse land-side investments needed in clean energy and zero-emission electro-fuel infrastructure at ports. The corridors approach enables governments to first incentivise and, eventually, require that only zero-emission ships can travel from, say, Shanghai to Los Angeles or Rotterdam to New York.</p>
